# Fan-project-control-table
## Project's description 
As students of the robotic pathway at ECAM we are supposed to, based on the experience of our applied internship, to complete missions and apply the skills we understood the last year to actual projects of robotics and/or informatics.
In that scope for this 7th semester of robotics, we were given the task of carrying out a project to be realized within a 2-month interval done while incorporating the scrum methodology we were introduced to at the beginning of the project.
Scrum is a framework for project management for teams between 3 to 9 developer and 1 Scrum master relying on breaking the work into goals that can be done in sprints (periods when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work) after carefully planning the dayâ€™s objective, after what there will be a review session and a retrospective on the work actually completed.
This opposes to the usual V-model minimizing risks but only producing value after a long time. We will be applying this new methodology the project we chose: *a ball-controlling table using fans*.

The main goal of the project is to create a system that can control the position of a ball regardless of its initial disturbances or position
The ball could move all over the board, thus, the goal is to ensure that at any given position of the ball, we are able to detect it position and move it to the centre of the table. We then adjust the speed of fans) depending on the position to control the ball. Finally we should potentially be able to have the ball follow more complex path
